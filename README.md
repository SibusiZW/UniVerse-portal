## Key Features

- Role-based authentication and authorization
- Course and enrollment management
- Announcements and notifications
- Simple admin dashboard and reports
- REST API for integration

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+ (or specify project runtime)
- npm or yarn
- A database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite for development)
- Optional: Docker for containerized deployment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd UniVerse-portal

2. Install dependencies
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install

3. Create a .env file (see Configuration)

4. Run database migrations / seeders (if included)
    npm run migrate
    npm run seed

5. Start the app
    npm start
    # or (development)
    npm run dev

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file at the project root and set required variables:

- PORT=3000
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/universe
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- NODE_ENV=development

Adjust other environment variables according to your environment and driver.

## Usage

  - npm run build — build production assets
  - npm start — run built app
  - npm test — run tests

## Deployment

- Single-server: build and run with NODE_ENV=production
- Docker: provide a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for multi-service setups (database + app)
- Use environment variables to configure secrets and DB connections in production.
