## Minimal backend requirements inferred from project files
# Pin Django to the version referenced in `backend/backend/settings.py` and include DRF
Django==5.2.7
djangorestframework>=3.14.0,<4

# If you use additional packages (e.g. django-environ, psycopg2-binary, django-cors-headers),
# add them here. You can generate a full file from your virtualenv with:
#   pip freeze > backend/requirements.txt
